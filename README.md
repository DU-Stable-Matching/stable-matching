# DU RA Stable Matching Algo

Implement a modified Galeâ€“Shapley algorithm to stably match RAs to Residence Halls based on preference lists generated by RD's and Applicants. Should be Residence Halls optimal, aka, Residence Halls should propose.

## Problem Details - (I think)
~80 RAs
6 Dorms
* 3 First Year
* 3 Upper-classman
* Some have LLCs and specific gender requirements, adding complexity

All Buildings can have first-year RAs (now RMs ig)

### Backend Stack
Java, Python, or straight TypeScript? DB - SQL (mySQL) v. noSQL (Mongo)?

### Frontend Stack
Probably React with like Node.js and other things, also, idk. I like tailwind css for styling so I already added the config but we can easily shift off that.

## Folder Structure

I have not shifted the default React template too much, just added some folder structure in src so we seperate our components, pages, etc.

api is reserved for our api layer if we choose to use any apis. tests is for tests, probably Jest tests?

## How to Run

1. clone repo
2. cd into `stable-matching` 
3. run `npm install` to generate `node_modules` 
4. run `npm start`

This will just show the default React default app screen as I have done nothing special to the web app itself.
