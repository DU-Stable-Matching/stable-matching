# DU RA Stable Matching Algo

Implement a modified Galeâ€“Shapley algorithm to stably match RAs to Residence Halls based on preference lists generated by RD's and Applicants. Should be Residence Halls optimal, aka, Residence Halls should propose.

## Problem Details - (I think)
~80 RAs
6 Dorms
* 3 First Year
* 3 Upper-classman
* Some have LLCs and specific gender requirements, adding complexity

All Buildings can have first-year RAs (now RMs ig)

### Backend Stack
Python - Django

### Frontend Stack
React using TypeScript

used create react app, can use other tool if we want 

## How to Run

1. clone repo
2. cd into `stable-matching` 
3. run `npm install` to generate `node_modules` 
4. run `npm start`

This will just show the default React default app screen as I have done nothing special to the web app itself.
